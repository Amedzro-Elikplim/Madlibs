# Madlibs

Mad Libs is the world’s greatest word game and can make anyone the funniest person in the room! Mad Libs are stories with words removed and replaced by blank spaces. One player acts as the “reader” and asks the other players, who haven’t seen the story, to fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, exclamations, colors, adjectives, and more. These words are inserted into the blanks and thenthe story is read aloud to hilarious results. For more information visit [ http://www.madlibslive.com/whats-a-mad-lib ].
